# Bismuth
Bismuth game engine is created using C and Vulkan. Only Windows will be supported.

I basically follow along [this series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHPuU-DJoBM&list=PLv8Ddw9K0JPg1BEO-RS-0MYs423cvLVtj&ab_channel=TravisVroman) and try to learn as much as I can about Vulkan and how to design complex systems from scratch.

## Prerequisites
